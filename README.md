# IS_HW3

Todo:

1.) Add one-hot array as labels. (done)
2.) Validate that forward and back prop are working on a small toy example.
2.01) Confirmed that forward prop works as expected. (done)
2.02) Backprop through 1st layer is good

2.1) Apply weight updates for each layer either per epoch or per sample

3.) Add a threshold to prevent learning if "good enough" i.e. above a target value.
