# IS_HW3

Todo:

1.) Add one-hot array as labels. (done)
2.) Validate that forward and back prop are working on a small toy example. (done)
2.01) Confirmed that forward prop works as expected. (done)
2.02) Backprop through 1st layer is good (done)

2.1) Apply weight updates for each layer either per epoch or per sample (done)

2.5) Rework network for MNIST data. (done)
3.) Benchmark timing for one hidden layer for MNIST sized problem. (done). 1 epoch/second on my tower with 10% of the training data each epoch.
4.) Add a threshold to prevent learning if "good enough" i.e. above a target value.
5.) Store hit rate every 10th (done)

6.) Maybe validate on the other portion of the training data that was not used in that batch.
7.) Add momentum (done)
